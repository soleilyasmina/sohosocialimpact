      <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
      <p>SoHo Social Impact is a collective dedicated to revitalizing the lost creative spirit of SoHo. Fostering collaboration among artists and local businesses, and by encouraging artists to engage with public space, we hope both to celebrate the artistic legacy of our city and to raise our awareness about the issues we face collectively.</p>
      <p>Historically, graffiti and “street art” has served as a medium for marginalized voices. In this galvanizing moment of social redress, there is a collaborative potential for public-facing facades to serve as a canvases for cultural discourse and inclusive reflection.</p>
      <p>We exist to foster revelation through artistic expression. We propose that the creative work of collaborating artists be preserved and shared publicly in virtual and physical exhibitions. We will establish an archive and facilitate conversations provoked by the work.</p>
      <p>If any of this resonates with you, if you wish to learn more or would like to participate in future collaborations, contact us at sohosocialimpact@gmail.com.</p>
